### Project Overview

Analyzed airline performance metrics to provide actionable insights for optimizing operations. This project involved cleaning and preparing data, designing interactive visualizations, and presenting key performance indicators, including passenger load factors and flight distributions, using Power BI. The goal was to support data-driven decision-making and enhance operational efficiency in the airline industry.

### Data Sources

#### Fact Table
- **MAIN.csv**: Contains the core data for the analysis.

#### Dimension Tables
- **Airlines.csv**: Provides details about the airlines.
- **DIST_GRP.csv**: Classifies data by distance groups.
- **Flight_types.csv**: Describes different types of flights.
- **Region.csv**: Includes information on various regions.

                  
### Tools Used

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- MySQL - Data Analysis
- Power BI - Data Visualization and Dashboard creation

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following steps were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the customer data to get Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Top 5 Airlines by Load Factor
- Top 10 Routes by Number of Flights
- Number of Flights by Distance Group
- Top 5 Destination Cities
- Flight Distribution by Weekdays & Weekend
- Top 10 Carriers by Passesnger preference

### Key Findings

- Passenger Load Factors: Identified trends in passenger load factors, revealing peak travel periods and areas for capacity optimization.
- Top Routes and Destinations: Determined the most popular routes and destinations based on flight frequency and passenger volume.
- Flight Distribution Patterns: Analyzed flight distributions across weekdays and weekends to understand scheduling impacts on passenger preferences.
- Top Carriers: Identified the top carriers based on passenger preference, offering insights into carrier performance and customer loyalty.

### Recommendations

- Optimize Flight Routes: Increase the frequency of flights on top-performing routes identified by high passenger load factors to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.
- Improve Customer Experience: Focus on enhancing services for the top 10 carriers by passenger preference to maintain and grow customer loyalty.
- Targeted Marketing: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for regions with lower load factors to boost occupancy and profitability.
- Adjust Flight Schedules: Modify flight schedules based on the analysis of flight distribution across weekdays and weekends to better align with passenger demand patterns.
- Expand Services in High-Demand Regions: Consider expanding operations or introducing new services in regions identified as having a high number of passengers, as these areas show strong potential for growth.
